# Layercake - MERN

## What is this?

[Layercake apps](https://github.com/harness_community/layercake/) strives to reflect modern best practices, but it's _goal_ isn't to educate you on how to write an application with any given stack. Instead, layercake is the very simplest example of an application requiring multiple layers so that you (developers) can learn how to deploy a given stack using [Harness.io](https://harness.io)

Modern application stacks can be described very much like a layer cake. Each layer describing a different piece of the system overall. The layercake project exists to provide sample application code written in a variety of 'stacks'. This repository holds the layercake example for the MERN, or Mongo, Express, React and Node stack.

## This layercake app uses:

-   [MongoDb](https://mongodb.com) for data persistence
-   [Express](https://expressjs.com) as the backend server framework
-   [React](https://reactjs.com) as the frontend framework
-   [Node](https://nodejs.org) as the server-side Javascript implementation.
